## Introduction

The epidemiology of the 2019-nCov in China is poorly understood.
Here we seek to develop a model for the transmission of 2019-nCov during the early stages of transmission in Wuhan.
This model may be useful for inference, forecasting or scenario analysis.

## Strategy

1. Develop a generative model based on clinical reports and outbreak investigations reported in the media and scientific literature.
2. Estimate unknown parameters by fitting to data.
3. Application of model to specific problems such as characterizing key unknown quantities (e.g. reporting rate) and forecasting.

## Model construction

Up to approximately January 25 the outbreak has remained small (hundreds of cases).
Therefore, we will focus on stochastic models with intrinsic noise.
